        <p>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;an assistant professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh, where I focus on composition studies and digital research. I have a PhD from The Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY) and an MFA in poetry from Columbia University's School of the Arts. Want more such facts?

            <h2>Writing and Editing</h2>
            <p>One theme connecting my writing is <em>finding one's way</em>. Both my poetry and my academic research explore the idea of maps and compasses, of knowing where you are by considering where you have been and where you might be going.</p>

                <p class="description">My first sole-authored academic book, <a href="https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/6234-distant-readings-of-disciplinarity"><em>Distant Readings of Disciplinarity: Knowing and Doing in Composition&#8203;/&#8203;Rhetoric Dissertations</em></a>, maps the methods and content of several thousand dissertations on rhetoric, composition, writing, and literacy, 2001–&#8203;2015. It was published in December 2022 by Utah State University Press as the inaugural book in their Writing Research, Pedagogy, and Policy series.</p>

                <p class="description">I&nbsp;am&nbsp;the coeditor with Dr. Amanda Licastro (University of Pennsylvania) of the book-length collection <a href="https://upittpress.org/books/9780822946748/"><em>Composition as Big Data</em></a>, published in Fall 2021 by University of Pittsburgh Press as part of their series in Composition, Literacy, and Culture. The book aims to kickstart a collective reckoning in RCWS with the role that algorithmic and computational approaches can, or should, play in our research and teaching. </p>

                <p class="description">I&nbsp;published my first collection of poetry, <a href="https://fourwaybooks.com/site/compass/"><em>Without Compass</em></a>, with Four Way Books in 2014. Poet Tom Healy described the book this way: “In his beautiful, bruised new book, <em>Without Compass</em>, Benjamin Miller presses questions on us about the risks of losing our bearings in the world of feeling. And his poems hurl us into new territory, answers that are somehow both brutal and comforting…. These gorgeous, painful poems map the unpredictable weather of the psyche: torrential, scorching, cold or calm. We would be lost without them.”</p>

            <h2>Teaching and Advising</h2>
            <p>Based in the Composition program and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design majors of the English department at Pitt, I teach a variety of classes in which students write with text, sound, images, and code.
