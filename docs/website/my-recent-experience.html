      <h2>SCHOOL</h2>

	  <p>I'm a rising senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Digital Media and Professional Communications. I have two working certificates in Corporate/Community Relations and Public and Professional Writing. My enthusiasm, knowledge of digital marketing principles, and excellent writing, organizational and project management skills have allowed me to develop and execute successful projects in school, my previous internships and my personal experiences. I am interested in digital media and digital marketing. I have studied business marketing fundamentals in school, but focused heavily around the digital application to marketing. To explain more, I am passionate about how to use digital applications to target audiences when dealing with various services/products. This can dapple in social media, or specific digital design softwares to create visuals or videos that are meant to focus on consumer relations. </p>
